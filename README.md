# Neovim configuration

The neovim configuration that I use. Heavily inspired by Josean Martinez's
[guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8).

## Mac OS pre-requisites

1. Make sure that Node is installed
2. Install ripgrep: `brew install ripgrep`

### As of 04.12.2022

In order for the `FocusGained`/`FocusLost` auto events to work properly with
iTerm2, I had to install the nightly version.
